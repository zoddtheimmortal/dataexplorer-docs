# all() (graph function)

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)] [!INCLUDE [monitor](../includes/applies-to-version/monitor.md)] [!INCLUDE [sentinel](../includes/applies-to-version/sentinel.md)]

The `all()` graph function evaluates a condition for each *edge* or *inner node* along a [variable length](graph-match-operator.md#variable-length-edge) path.

> [!NOTE]
> This function is used with the [graph-match](graph-match-operator.md) and [graph-shortest-paths](graph-shortest-paths-operator.md) operators.

## Syntax

`all(`*edge*`,` *condition*`)`

`all(inner_nodes(`*edge*`),` *condition*`)`

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *edge* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | A variable length edge from the [graph-match operator](graph-match-operator.md) or [graph-shortest-paths operator](graph-shortest-paths-operator.md) pattern. For more information, see [Graph pattern notation](graph-match-operator.md#graph-pattern-notation). |
| *condition* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | A Boolean expression composed of properties of the *edge* or *inner node*, when [inner_nodes](inner-nodes-graph-function.md) is used, in the [variable length edge](./graph-match-operator.md#variable-length-edge). A property is referenced using the property name directly. The expression is evaluated for each *edge* or *inner node* in the [variable length edge](./graph-match-operator.md#variable-length-edge). |

## Returns

Returns `true` if the condition evaluates to `true` for each  *edge* or *inner node*, when [inner_nodes](inner-nodes-graph-function.md) is used, in the [variable length edge](graph-match-operator.md#variable-length-edge). Otherwise, it returns `false`.

For zero length paths, the condition evaluates to `true`.

## Examples

The following example shows how to use the `graph-match` operator with the `all()` function to find all round-trip paths between two stations in a transportation network. It uses a different line for each direction. The query constructs a graph from the `connections` data, finding all paths up to five connections long that use the `"red"` line for the outward route, and the `"blue"` line for the return route. The `all()` function ensures that all edges in the variable length edge are part of the same line, either `"red"` or `"blue"`.

          back=start.station
```

**Output**

|from|outward_stations|to|return_stations|back|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Central|North->Central->South->South-West|West||Central|
|West|South-West->South->Central->North|Central||West|

The following example shows how to use the `graph-shortest-paths` operator  with the `all()` and `inner_nodes` functions to find a path between two stations in a transportation network. The query constructs a graph from the `connections` data and finds the shortest path from the `"South-West"` station to the `"North"` station, passing through stations where Wi-Fi is available.
